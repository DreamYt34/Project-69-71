        <h5 class="text-left text-success text capitalize">I had visited this place at july 24 2018</h5>
        <p class="text-muted text-left"> IT's a good place, My first grade teacher actually worked there part-time and liked to restaurant. The reason why I like this place so much is because of the quality of the food these days. Normally other chinese restaurants would have normal plates stuff like that, but bai tong actually changes your entire view of dining. The waiters have cool clothes and sporty shoes. And the food itself would give me a five star. THe food is made with such quality that I actually recommended it to my friend, my cousins and even my own dad to eat there again! I hope you can go try it sometime soon. Bye!</p>

              Heart health. The American Heart Association (AHA) state that almost half of U.S. adults live with some form of cardiovascular disease.
              Reduced cancer risk. Eating foods that contain antioxidants can reduce a person’s risk of developing cancer by protecting cells from damage.
              Better mood. Some evidence suggests a close relationship between diet and mood. ...
              Improved gut health. The colon is full of naturally occurring bacteria, which play important roles in metabolism and digestion.
              Improved memory. A healthful diet may help maintain cognition and brain health. A 2015 study identified nutrients and foods that protect against cognitive decline and dementia.”

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A slew of letters from children concerned about plastic pollution has prompted Lego to pledge to switch to cardboard packaging for its products from 2021.

        As well as ditching single-use plastic packaging, the brand has committed to finding an alternative material for its iconic building blocks, which are made out of plastic.
       
        “We have received many letters from children about the environment asking us to remove single-use plastic packaging,” Lego Group chief executive, Niels B Christiansen, told the BBC. “We have been exploring alternatives for some time and the passion and ideas from children inspired us to begin to make the change.”
